I do many things.

One of those things is administrating and writing for [iLizwi](http://ilizwi.co.za), which is perhaps what you're looking for.

I study Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. There, I'm also involved in a few other things: I'm the 2020 Education Executive of [QueerUS](http://stelliesqueer.us) and I am a founding member of [Students for a Democratic Society South Africa](http://sdsafrica.co.za). Feel free to contact me with any queries!

I have experience in everything from administrating and designing websites, graphic design, video editing, photography, to Linux sysadmin and programming. I regularly write opinion or op-ed pieces, and proofread articles and essays. Through QueerUS and various other University structures, I have presented numerous workshops and info-sessions, and facilitated critical engagements and conflict mediations.
