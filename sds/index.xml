      <description>Students for a Democratic Society formed from students who question the given status quo and the concepts that accompany it. We realise that the &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; conception of the world necessarily work to the benefit of certain people, and to the detriment of others. We believe that critical inquiry into these hegemonic concepts is necessary, and that they must be deconstructed and the concepts reclaimed into an emancipatory project. We consider ourselves &amp;ldquo;radicals&amp;rdquo; in the sense that we vow to address problems at their roots, and that we believe superficial temporary solutions are not good enough.</description>

      <description>Students for a Democratic Society South Africa formed in 2019 at Stellenbosch University. A group of students started a Political Philosophy reading group, but soon found the literature ununderstandable and stale, and their frustrations with local, national, and international politics too immediate. That group of students formed a prefigurative organisation with the goal of spreading political knowledge and literacy, and encouraging skepticism about those elements of society we take for granted.</description>

      <description>SDS aims to enable people to analyse and scrutinise their given preconceptions of society. We want to equip people with the necessary analytical tools to critically evaluate the function of different elements in society. We want to demystify academic concepts and make them accessible to the average student. We also aim to organise ourselves in a prefigurative horizontal manner, consistent with our vision.</description>

      <description>The members of SDS envision a future where society is structured to care for the individual, where individuals are not forced to adapt to a malignant social structure, and where everyone&amp;rsquo;s fundamental human needs are fulfilled. We envision a world where everyone can have compassion for their fellow humans, and for the environment in which we reside. We envision a society where damaging structures of society can be eradicated as fast as possible, as soon as they are identified.</description>
