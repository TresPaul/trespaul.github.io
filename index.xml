      <description>I recently appeared on an episode of Air-It, a podcast by Nicolene Burger and Jana Vosloo, to talk about Gender Abolition. Here are some texts that we spoke about, as well as a several others that you might find interesting. As you&amp;rsquo;ll see, it&amp;rsquo;s quite extensive and wide-ranging &amp;mdash; sometimes even contradictory &amp;mdash; and so is not meant as a &amp;ldquo;primer&amp;rdquo; but more as a list of sources that I find interesting around the topic.</description>

      <description>I do many things.
One of those things is administrating and writing for iLizwi , which is perhaps what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.
I study Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. There, I&amp;rsquo;m also involved in a few other things: I&amp;rsquo;m the 2020 Education Executive of QueerUS and I am a founding member of Students for a Democratic Society South Africa . Feel free to contact me with any queries!</description>
